Installation for Developers
###########################

If you want to work on the codebase, you can fork and clone the repository from 
`GitHub <https://github.com/csfunke/ZEN-creator>`_.

If it's your first time using GitHub, register at `<https://github.com/>`_. 
After you have created an account, you can fork and clone the repository.

Navigate to `<https://github.com/csfunke/ZEN-creator>`_ on Github and click 
on the "Fork" button at the top right corner of the page to create a copy of the 
repository under your account and select yourself as the owner.

**Clone your forked repository:**

Clone your forked repository by running the following lines in `Git-Bash 
<https://git-scm.com/downloads>`_::

    git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/ZEN-creator.git
    cd ZEN-creator

Substitute ``<your-username>`` with your Github username. If you gave the forked 
repository a different name, replace ``ZEN-creator`` with the name of your 
repository.

.. note::
    If you get the permissions error "Permission denied (publickey)", you will 
    need to create the SSH key. Follow the instructions on `how to generate an 
    SSH key <https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#generating-a-new-ssh-key>`_ 
    and then `how to add it to your account <https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account#adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-account>`_. 
    You will not need to add the SSH key to the Agent, so only follow the first 
    website until before `Adding your SSH key to the ssh-agent <https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#adding-your-ssh-key-to-the-ssh-agent>`_

**Track the upstream repository:**

In your terminal window, navigate to the folder in which ZEN-creator was
installed (i.e. the folder where the file ``zen_creator_env.yml`` is located)::

    cd <path_to_zen_creator_repo>

Track the upstream repository by running the following lines in Git-Bash::

    git remote add upstream https://github.com/ZEN-universe/ZEN-creator.git
    git fetch upstream

**Create the ZEN-creator conda environment:**

Open the Anaconda Prompt application. This is a terminal window provided by
Anaconda which allows you to run Anaconda commands.

In the Anaconda Prompt, change the directory to the root directory of your 
local ZEN-creator repository i.e. the folder where the file 
``zen_creator_env.yml`` is located::

  cd <path_to_zen_creator_repo>

Now you can install the conda environment for zen-creator with the following 
command::

  conda env create -f zen_creator_env.yml

The installation may take a couple of minutes. If the installation was 
successful, you can see the environment at 
``C:\Users\<username>\anaconda3\envs`` or wherever Anaconda is installed.

.. note::
    If you forked the ZEN-creator repository and created the environment from 
    ``zen_creator_env.yml``, then the environment will by default be 
    called ``zen-creator-env``.

.. note::
    We strongly recommend working with conda environments. When installing the 
    zen-creator conda environment via the ``zen_creator_env.yml``, the ZEN-creator 
    package, as well as all other dependencies, are installed automatically.
