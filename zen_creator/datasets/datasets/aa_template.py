class TemplateDataset(Dataset[pd.DataFrame]):
    """
    Template class for datasets. This template is designed as a starting point
    for users wishing to implement a new dataset. Please read the
    docstrings and comments carefully for notes on how to use the template.

    All datasets must inherit from the Dataset class and implement the required abstract
    methods. These methods are called during the construction of the dataset object to
    set the metadata, path, and data properties of the dataset. Each of
    these methods is marked with a `TODO` comment to indicate
    that they must be implemented. You can search for `TODO` in this file to quickly
    find all the places where you need to make changes.

    The Dataset class takes a generic type parameter which specifies the
    return type of the data property. Please set this to the appropriate type
    for your dataset (e.g., pd.DataFrame, Dict[str, pd.DataFrame], etc.) and
    adjust the return type of _get_data() accordingly. In this template, we have set
    it to pd.DataFrame for demonstration purposes.

    All Datasets are singleton objects, meaning that they only get constructed once
    regardless of how many times they are instantiated. This is because datasets can be
    large and expensive to load, so we want to avoid loading them multiple times.
    The first time a dataset is instantiated, it will be constructed and loaded
    as normal. The second time it is instantiated, the existing instance will
    be returned instead of constructing a new one. This means that the constructor
    and the methods called during construction (i.e., the methods marked
    with `TODO` comments) will only be called once, even if the dataset is
    instantiated multiple times. This also means that the raw data only gets loaded
    once, and subsequent instantiations of the dataset will use the already loaded data.
